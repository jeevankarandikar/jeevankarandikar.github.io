  <h1>a glimpse into my brain</h1>
  <p>
    i am a third-year bioengineering student at uc san diego passionate about brain computer interfaces, 
    neuromorphic systems, medical devices, and robotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    from delving into the nuances of nutritional science and endocrinology to envisioning a world 
    powered by renewable energy my appetite for knowledge is endless. i also find myself captivated 
    by the threads of behavioral and developmental psychology, world history, and the 
    awe-inspiring reign of dinosaurs. quantum mechanics and relativity are also cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    ultimately i love to learn, and i aspire to use my experiences and skills to further my ambition 
    for all humans to have access to the tools and opportunities needed to explore their passions so they can unleash 
    their distinct talents upon the world, contributing to the greater mosaic of human potential.
