        <h1>a glimpse into my brain</h1>
        <p>
            i am a fourth-year undergraduate bioengineering student passionate about brain computer interfaces, 
            neuromorphic systems, medical devices, and robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            from delving into the nuances of nutritional science and endocrinology to envisioning a world powered 
            by renewable energy, my appetite for knowledge is endless. i also find myself captivated by the threads of 
            behavioral and developmental psychology, anthropology, and the awe-inspiring reign of dinosaurs. 
            quantum mechanics and relativity are also cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            ultimately i love to learn, and i aspire to use my experiences and skills to further my ambition for all 
            humans to have access to the tools and opportunities needed to explore their passions so they can unleash 
            their distinct talents upon the world, contributing to the greater mosaic of human potential.
