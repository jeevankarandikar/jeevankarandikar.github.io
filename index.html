  <h1>A Glimpse into Jeevan Karandikar's Brain</h1>
  <p>
    I am a third-year bioengineering student at UC San Diego absorbed in the neurotech startup space. 
    My primary interests in the field are brain-computer interfaces, neural networks, and robotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    My appetite for knowledge extends to diverse fields â€” from delving into the secrets of nutritional 
    science and unraveling the mysteries of endocrinology to envisioning a world powered by renewable energy. 
    I also find myself captivated by the intricate threads of behavioral psychology, world history, 
    and the awe-inspiring reign of dinosaurs. Quantum mechanics is also cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately I love to learn, and I aspire to use my unique experiences and skills to further my ambition 
    for all humans to have access to the tools and opportunities to explore their passions so they can unleash 
    their distinct talents upon the world, contributing to the greater mosaic of human potential.
