  <h1>A Glimpse into Jeevan Karandikar's Brain</h1>
  <p>
    I am a third-year bioengineering student at UC San Diego passionate about brain computer interfaces, 
    neuromorphic systems, medical devices, and robotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    My appetite for knowledge extends to diverse fields â€” from delving the nuances of nutritional 
    science and endocrinology to envisioning a world powered by renewable energy. 
    I also find myself captivated by the threads of behavioral and developmental psychology, world history, 
    and the awe-inspiring reign of dinosaurs. Quantum mechanics is also cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately I love to learn, and I aspire to use my experiences and skills to further my ambition 
    for all humans to have access to the tools and opportunities needed to explore their passions so they can unleash 
    their distinct talents upon the world, contributing to the greater mosaic of human potential.
